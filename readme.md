Gulp Tasks Repository
=====================
This is a repository containing various Gulp tasks, that can be used in your projects.
They are all split in separate files, to make it easy to copy what you need.

Currently Work in Progress

##Getting started
The following tools are required when developing the project locally:

####Prerequisites
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/ "Node")
  Make sure node is installed and paths are configured, so you can use **npm** from the terminal.

* [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp "Gulp")
  Make sure Gulp is installed globally.

		npm install -g gulp

* [Bower](http://bower.io/ "Bower")
  Make sure Bower is installed globally.

		npm install -g bower


After the required tools are installed, you should download the required Node modules by calling:

	npm install

This will also trigger a bower install, that installs the HTML frameworks needed. After this has been performed, the project should be ready to compile.
